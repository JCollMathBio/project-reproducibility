## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Characteristics of Open Science, following @Fecher2014:

"Our professional network is valuable. It is also limited. Perhaps there are people who are well-placed to help us, in another university or company, in a different country, but we unfortunately do not know them. Surely science would proceed faster if we could reach those people? Or, better, if they could find us?"[@woelfle2011open; @Fecher2014]

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## problems with open science: why has it been hard to do open science? what are the hurdles? How can we encourage changing current data sharing practices?

Institutions have a reward system by publication on journals with high impact factor and by number of publications. The former encourages journals toonly publish high impact research, that supports current beliefs. This promotes researchers to ignore negative results and only publish positive results or to look for data sets that support statistically signifcant relationships. The latter encourages researchers to hold on to their data so the researchers do not take advantage of their data before them, and they can have more publications.
